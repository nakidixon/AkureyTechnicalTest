For this exercise I decided to work on an object-oriented model. I abstracted what would be a programming language as my initial class. It contains a name (Python example) and a namespace. A namespace contains one or more classes so create a class called Class that contains Attributes, values and a size. Attributes are classes that contain a data type which would be the Datatype class.

For each class located inside the Model folder, there is a controller (it has no functions inside) however, it represents the container that stores the CRUD functions for each object.

In addition to that we find the Lib folder that contains the libraries that will be used in each programming language
And finally it contains a folder called View (equally empty) that is responsible for containing the view of the Metalanguage program.

In this way, structured with an MVC, it will be possible to ensure that the program is suitable for adding more programming languages ​​in the future without making massive changes within the code.
